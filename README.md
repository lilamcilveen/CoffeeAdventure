## The Game
- A (human) `Player` enters the game `World` (already containing other Players and Things). 
- The goal of the game is for the Player to retrieve something from the game World and exit with it (be it another `Player` or `Thing`).
- The game world is read from a file that specifies each `Room` in the World. 
- Each Room lists contents such as Things, Players, and exits (doors to other rooms).

## Details
The game has the following classes forming the base of it: `World`, `Room`, `Player` and `Thing`.
  
#### World: 
- The `World` class reads the game world from a file. 
- It keeps track of the entrance to the World so that the human Player can enter it.
- It can save a game in progress. That is, save the state of the game so that it can be loaded later and continued (from the same point in the game). 
- Holds the collection of Rooms using a linked-list structure.
    
#### Room: 
- A `Room` is where everything happens. 
- Contains Players, Things and doors to other Rooms. 
- Any Player (AI or human) can take things from a Room and leave things in a Room. 
- Doorways between Rooms can be simple doors, be locked or one-way (you can go from room A to B, but not from B to A). 
- A basic Room has 1-4 adjacent Rooms.
    
#### Player: 
- Each `Player` has a specific role in the game. 
- There are several Players in the game:&nbsp;&nbsp; a human Player;&nbsp; and at least 3 AI, with different behaviours.
- For the human Player, North, South, East, and West are used to denote directions.
    
#### Thing: 
- There are several classes and instances of `Thing` in the game. Examples are `Coffee`, `Poison`, `EnergyDrink`, etc. 
- Each has a different behaviour upon interaction.
    
### File Format
The file format for the world is as follows:
  
      - total number of rooms
      - room number
      - room name
      - rooms adjacent to room (comma separated)
      - players in room (comma separated)
      - things in the room (comma sepatated)
      - room number
      - room name
      - rooms adjacent to room (comma separated)
      - players in room (comma separated)
      - ...
      
######  For example, if there are 4 rooms in the world (2x2 grid) then the file might look like this. Professor Hinek included this example for clarity of the project. Our file is `input.txt`.
  
        4                           # 4 rooms in total
        1                           # room 1
        Entrance                    # room 1 is the Entrance
        2, 3                        # you can go to room 2 and 3 from room 1
        0, 1, 0, 1                  # there is one player1 and one player3 in the room
        1, 1, 0, 0, 0               # there is one thing0 and thing1 in the room
        2                           # room 2
        CS Lab                      # room 2 is the CS lab
        1, 4                        # you can go to room 1 and 4 from room 2
        0, 0, 0, 0                  # there are no players in the room
        0, 1, 0, 0, 0               # there is one thing1 in the room
        3                           # room 3
        Washroom                    # The washroom
        1, 4                        # you can go to room 1 and 4 from room 3
        0, 0, 0, 0                  # no player is in the washroom
        0, 0, 0, 0, 1               # there is one thing4 in the room
        4                           # room 4
        2, 3                        # you can go to room 2 and 3 from room 4
        1, 0, 0, 0                  # there is one player1 in the room
        0, 0, 1, 0, 1               # there is one thing2 and thing4 in the room
         
###### Resulting in this room layout:

      | 1 | 2 |
      | 3 | 4 |

> ###### "You can store the game using a 2d array or using a linked structure. [...] you can assume that the world looks like a rectangle. The first room (#1) is the top-left room. The rooms are then given (in order of room number) and will be given as the rows. You will need to determine the shape (number of rows and columns) based on which rooms room # 1 is adjacent to." â€• Professor Hinek
  
### Project Rubric

Things ending with a number correspond to work done by team a team member (which we arbitrarily number 1-4). Anything ending with 0 is a team effort.

    All games must accept the input "h" to ask for help. This should let the user know which commands that they can enter to 
    play the game.

    Team
    __/10 : human player can navigate the world (look around, pick things up, etc)
    __/5 : UML diagram or PDF drawing of all classes in submission
    __/5 : class design (abstract/concrete/interface) 
    __/2 : file i/o (read world initial state to begin game)
    __/3 : game play (user friendly, easy to follow, etc)


    Individual
    __/10 : Player class P1 - player does something non-trivial/unique
    __/10 : Player class P2 - player does something non-trivial/unique
    __/10 : Player class P3 - player does something non-trivial/unique
    __/10 : Player class P4 - player does something non-trivial/unique

    __/5 : Thing class T1 - thing does something non-trivial/unique
    __/5 : Thing class T2 - thing does something non-trivial/unique
    __/5 : Thing class T3 - thing does something non-trivial/unique
    __/5 : Thing class T4 - thing does something non-trivial/unique

    Extras (individual)
    __/ : file i/o (save game to be continued later)
    __/ : other1
    __/ : other2
    __/ : other3
    __/ : other4
